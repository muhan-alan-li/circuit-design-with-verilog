# Collection of lab files created over the course of a semester for a hardware course at UBC

- **Table of contents**
  - *Labs 1 and 2 have been ommitted as they did not contain any circuit design with verilog or writing of ARM assembly*
  
  3. Combinational logic and finite state machines in Verilog
  4. Translating C to ARM Assembly (very basic)
  5. Datapath module for a simple RISC in Verilog
  6. Finite State Machine controller for a simple RISC in Verilog
  7. Memory and I/O for the simple RISC in Verilog

- **Miscellaneous Notes**
  - Each lab was about 36-48 hours of work between me and my lab partner
  - Each lab folder contins a contributions file that lists the work done by me (Muhan) and my partner
